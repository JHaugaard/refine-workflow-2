# Session Context

## Current Focus

**Multi-Model Review of Workflow System**

Using Zen MCP to access other models for comprehensive analysis of the refactored workflow skills and templates.

## Scope Boundaries

- ALL work is LOCAL to `/Volumes/dev/skill-foundry/refine-workflow-2/`
- Production skills at `/Users/john/.claude/skills/` are READ-ONLY (reference only)
- No deployment to user-level skills without explicit instruction

## Project Overview

This workflow system contains:
- **9 skills** orchestrated via manifest
- **Templates folder** for bootstrapping new projects
- **Manifest-based orchestration** (v3 schema)
